# enigma
Mod 1 Final Project

Self-evaluation:
Functionality: 3
Encrypt and decrypt work, as well as successful commmand line interfaces. Cracking method works, however couldn't get the key so couldn't fully test, display correct result, or run command line interface exactly correct. Edit: Upon further testing crakc doesn;t work every time. Need to look into the issue.

Object Oriented Programming: 3
At least 4 classes (if modules count). Couple longer methods, but only incomplete ones that were part of attempting iteration 4. Variable and method names alright, but could use some work. Has module(s) which could be used outside of Enigma. No class method used. Organization and naming could be improved.

TDD: 3
Technically not every method is tested and test coverage is below 99%, but that is only because of some of the tests involved in attempting to find the key for iteration 4. Hiding/deleting those blocks would bring coverage to 99%. Every meaningful/use dmethod is tested. Tests written before implentation of code. No mocks/stubs. Tests named well. Edit: Test coverage now 100% after removing incomplete code.

Version control: 3
Hit the 40 commits and 15 pull requests. Think named and documented pretty clearly. Some commits include multiple pieces of funcitonality. Edit: Shouldn't have merged incomplete/not working code.
